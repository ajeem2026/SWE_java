## Skills Overview

### 1. **Programming Fundamentals**
   - **Java Basics**: Syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.
   - **Classes and Objects**: Object-oriented programming principles, encapsulation, and modular code design.
   - **Error Handling**: Exception handling, debugging, and best practices in error management.

### 2. **Version Control**
   - **Git and GitHub**: Setting up repositories, committing changes, branching, and collaborating on code.
   - **Version Control Concepts**: Understanding branching models, merge conflicts, and pull requests.
   - **Project Setup**: Initializing and maintaining organized project structures with Git.

### 3. **Software Testing**
   - **Unit Testing with JUnit**: Writing and executing test cases, ensuring code reliability.
   - **Test Coverage and Mutation Testing**: Analyzing test coverage and implementing white-box testing techniques.
   - **Refactoring for Testing**: Ensuring code readability, maintainability, and effective test coverage.

### 4. **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**
   - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Building reusable and scalable code with inheritance hierarchies.
   - **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Defining clear and flexible APIs for modular development.
   - **Design Principles**: Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and SOLID principles.

### 5. **Collections and Data Structures**
   - **Java Collections Framework**: Mastering Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations.
   - **Algorithms and Efficiency**: Sorting, searching, and efficient data handling in Java.

### 6. **Software Development Methodologies**
   - **Agile and Iterative Development**: Introduction to Agile principles, Scrum practices, and iterative development.
   - **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Decorator, Factory, Strategy, and MVC patterns to enhance code reusability and structure.
   - **Refactoring**: Recognizing and fixing code smells, improving readability, and maintaining extensible code.

### 7. **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**
   - **Swing Framework**: Building GUIs with Java Swing for interactive user applications.
   - **Event Handling**: Implementing responsive and user-friendly interfaces through event-driven programming.

### 8. **Advanced Java Concepts**
