## Reasons for choosing list (ArrayList) implementation


1. This was the easiest one to implement and involved least amount of changes from my initial driver
2. Set was not a good option because, in real-world libraries, there are duplicate elements
3. Java has an easy way to sort lists where I can just use Collections.sort()
4. The indexing feature of lists is something that I find useful as it gives an order and ease for storing and retrieval 

For these reasons, I chose list as a collection for my second driver!
